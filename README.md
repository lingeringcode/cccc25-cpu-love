# NCTE CCCC 2025 Interactive Learning Session: Remixing Writing Pedagogies With Writing Code and Data Through Exploratory Data Analysis

## Abstract

What is our discipline’s role in teaching and advocating for critical approaches to writing data? The facilitator and attendees will work through a computational notebook together that conducts exploratory data analysis. This coding and data process is meant to facilitate discussion to learn more about what writing and technical communication can bring to data practices.

The goal will be to learn more about the problems and potential for writing and technical and professional communication (TPC) scholars and teachers to teach coding and data practices, such as machine learning and data modeling, with a humanities-driven, advocacy approach.

Novices and experts are all welcome and encouraged to attend. No previous experience coding is required, since this ELE is meant to facilitate a discussion about the role that writing and TPC plays pedagogically beyond using (or not using) generative AI tools.
